I am a postgraduate student in the School of Electronic and Information Engineering, South China University of Technology. My research advisors are [Prof. Changxing Ding](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8Z8jplgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao) and [Prof. Dacheng Tao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=RwlJNLcAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao). I received my Bachelorâ€™s Degree in [South China University of Technology](http://www.scut.edu.cn/) (2018). Now I pursue my Master's Degree in in [South China University of Technology](http://www.scut.edu.cn/).

My Research Experience is as following:

Facial Expression Recognition with IFR, HOS and CC} Jun. 2018 - May. 2021 (Expected)}
Postgraduate Student, Supervised by Prof. Changxing Ding and Prof. Dacheng Tao.
We recognize the categorized emotion of an image which is captured in the challenging wild and accomplish accuracies of 78.46\% on RAF database and 34.48\% on EMOTIC database. 
% The main processes include: 
Key Responsibilities:
1) excavate important expression regions (IER) based on keypoints and attention mechanism to detect subtle facial motion, improve the accuracy on RAF database by 0.54% 
2) calculate high-order statistics(HOS) based on low-rank bilinear pooling, improve the accuracy on RAF database by 0.4\% compared to normal bilinear pooling 
3) incorporate context clues (CC) based on specific multi-view attention fusion, improve the accuracy on EMOTIC database by 0.91\% compared to normal attention fusion. 


In recent years, my research mainly focuses on Facial Expression Recognition, 
which is critical to understanding human behavior. 
However, in the physiological perspective, 
the corporal mechanism of human expression generation,
experience and perception is not clear; 
in the computing perspective, the establishment of reliable datasets, 
mathematical models and the recognition accuracy are still not satisfactory.

My current goal is to figure out an effective solution for emotion analysis 
and develop a facial expression analysis toolkit like OpenFace. 

Besides, when seeking solutions for expression analysis, 
I pay attention to the research of machine learning such as multi-label learning, class imbalance, label uncertainty and multimodal fusion. And I am greatly interested in these theoretical problems!
